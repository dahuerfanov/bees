# Bees Challenge

## Challenge Description

We want to count the number of bees flying around in order to monitor the hive. You are given a sample set of images
of bees, along with ground truth labels containing dots at the centroids of each bee in the image. The goal of this
challenge is to automate the process of counting bees in a given image.

## Submission Details

Your submission should include a test program that can be run to make predictions on new image, e.g.

    ./sample_solution.py <image file>

* `image file` is an image, possibly with bees. Your model should predict how many bees are in this image.

Please include code on how you created your model and assessed its performance, along with some explanation
on why you chose your method. You should also include some unit testing (it doesn't HAVE to be fully tested)
to showcase an example of how you would unit test your algorithm/method/model in the real world. You may
want to include other material such as a pdf or jupyter notebook in order to show your results.

## Evaluation

Your challenge results will be evaluated based on the following criteria
- model performance
- code cleanliness, documentation, and testing
- level of creativity / ingenuity of your solution

## Questions?

Feel free to email us with any questions you might have about the challenge.

Looking forward to your submission!
